## Modify the CHANGELOG.md

Our CHANGELOG.md follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format. For every change add an Unreleased section by copying this format and adding it to the top of the CHANGELOG.md:

```md
## [Unreleased] - [<release type>]
### Changed
- <Describe changes>
```

Supported release types:
- major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease | from-git
